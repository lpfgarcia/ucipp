%%  Data Set Information:
%%  
%%  In this paper, we look for to recognize the causes of users tend 
%%  to cyber space in Kohkiloye and Boyer Ahmad Province in 
%%  Iran. Collecting information to form database is done by 
%%  questionnaire. This questionnaire is provided as oral, written 
%%  and also programming of a website which includes an internet 
%%  questionnaire and the users can answer the questions as they 
%%  wish. They entered their used websites, blogs and social 
%%  networks during the day. 
%%  After collecting questionnaires, the wed addresses are 
%%  gathered to get expected results. And finally, their trustfulness 
%%  is checked by analyzing their used web pages. As the results 
%%  were same, for getting better and noiseless response, they will 
%%  put in database
%%  
%%  
%%  Attribute Information:
%%  
%%  We considered the following parameters as questions: age, 
%%  education, political attitudes, blog topic, and the type of the 
%%  identity in internet, the influence of managersâ€™ inefficiency on 
%%  tendency, the effect of inefficient media on tendency, the 
%%  effects of social and political conditions on tendency and 
%%  finally the effect of poverty in the province on tendency. The 
%%  noisy or too detailed data in database makes us far from to get 
%%  proper and suitable answers of algorithms [8]. We preprocessed 
%%  the data and eliminated some non-relevant data. 
%%  Finally the followings are considered as the main fields which 
%%  include: education, political caprice, topics, local media 
%%  turnover (LMT) and local, political and social space (LPSS). 
%%  The collected data are shown in Table 1. 
%%  In order to get correct answer, we classify bloggers to two 
%%  groups: professional bloggers and seasonal (temporary) 
%%  bloggers. Professional bloggers are those who adopt blog as 
%%  an effective digital media and interested in digital writing in 
%%  continuous time intervals. Seasonal (temporary) bloggers 
%%  arenâ€™t professional and follow blogging in discrete time 
%%  periods. In this study, we review the tendency factors 
%%  considering whether these people are among professional 
%%  bloggers (Pro Bloggers, PB) and then, consider the other 
%%  factors according to it.
